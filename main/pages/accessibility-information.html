  <h2>Guests visiting with Service Animals</h2>
  Trained Service Animals are welcome to the Globe-City Resort Highland. <u>Animals who do not meet the definition of a Service Animal will not be permitted in the park.</u> Service Animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the Service Animal’s work or the individual’s disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls.<br><br>To help you make an informed decision about your service animal’s safety, each attraction has specific entry and boarding requirements, as well as portable kennels at certain attractions. Relief areas for your service animal are also available at select locations throughout the parks. For more information, please speak with an attendant or see the <a href='https://aztechadmit.github.io/gcresorthighland/resortsafety'>Resort Safety Guidelines.</a>
